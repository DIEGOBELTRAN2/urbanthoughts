    <h1>The Importance of Human-Scaled Cities</h1>

    <p>Welcome to our page discussing the significance of creating cities that are <span class="highlight">human-scaled</span>,
        <span class="highlight">non-car-centric</span>, <span class="highlight">bicycle-friendly</span>, <span class="highlight">mixed-use</span>, and <span class="highlight">compact</span>.</p>

    <p>In today's urban planning, it's crucial to focus on designs that enhance the quality of life for residents and promote
        sustainable development. Here's why these principles are vital:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="list-item"><span class="highlight">Human-Scaled:</span> Emphasizes a pedestrian-friendly environment, fostering
            community engagement and a sense of belonging.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><span class="highlight">Non-Car-Centric:</span> Reduces traffic congestion, air pollution, and
            promotes alternative, eco-friendly transportation methods.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><span class="highlight">Bicycle-Friendly:</span> Encourages a healthy lifestyle, reduces carbon
            emissions, and enhances accessibility for cyclists.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><span class="highlight">Mixed-Use:</span> Creates vibrant, diverse neighborhoods where people can live,
            work, and socialize in close proximity.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><span class="highlight">Compact:</span> Maximizes land use efficiency, minimizes urban sprawl, and
            supports sustainable infrastructure development.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By incorporating these principles into urban planning, we can build cities that are not only sustainable and efficient but also
        prioritize the well-being of their residents.</p>
